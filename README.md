# How to use Mechazilla?
Catching a booster mid-flight could be an immensely complex and high-risk task to do, luckily SofieBrink developed and coded a plug-in to improve the capabilities of Mechazilla to move, I’ll give you some tips to use it correctly without waking up Kraken:
- To perfectly align the arms with Starship, rotate the arms 8°.
- Only use max speed while trying to catch the booster or moving the arms lonely. With a booster/ship caught, I’ll recommend you use these movement speeds:
	- Vertical movement: 0.5m/s.  
	- Arms swing movement: 1°/s
	- Pushers movement: 0.2m/s
- To stabilize the vessel at the top do not ever close the pushers completely, instead use these pushers open limit values:
	- Starship (Ship): 0.7m
	- Super Heavy (Booster): 0.2m
- Using the stabilizers could be a bit buggy, that’s why there is a target extension to adjust it to your vessel, there are 2 colliders options to use:
	- Single Axis
		This will stabilize your vessel in a single horizontal axis, it works fine just do not move the pushers insanely fast, this is the lesser summoner of the Kraken.
	- Double Axis
		This will stabilize your vessel in both horizontal axes so you can move the pushers more freely with the vessel always completely vertical, however, it is a delicious plate for the Kraken so be aware using it.
